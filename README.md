## Tic-Tac-Toe

### Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java's Swing library. The game provides a graphical user interface where players can take turns placing their symbols (either "O" or "X") on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all the spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

### Features
- Graphical user interface with clickable buttons for player interaction.
- Keeps track of player turns and displays which player's turn it is.
- Tracks the number of wins for each player.
- Provides a "New Game" button to start a new game.
- Notifies the players of the game outcome (win, draw).

### How to Play
1. Run the `tictactoe.java` file to start the game.
2. Player 1 starts the game with the symbol "O".
3. Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their symbols.
4. The first player to align three of their symbols wins the game.
5. Click "New Game" to start a new game at any time.

### Development
This game was developed using Java and Swing library for the graphical user interface. The codebase consists of a single Java file `tictactoe.java` which contains the main game logic and user interface components.
